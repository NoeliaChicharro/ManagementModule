= Kick off

== What happens when you fist arrive at your office?

. Write down all the clients goals.
    - Should be measurable
    - Should be doable
    - Should be realistic
. Priority List (define with client) (MoSCoW Method)
. Keep in mind, that everyone in the team should be fine with the goals.
. Team evaluation:
    - What are each persons strengths.
    - How available are those persons. (does everyone work 100% on the project?)
    - Hardware should also be considert (if you don't own something, it should be in the budget)
    - Software
. Risk management

== Budget
. Scatual
    - Don't underestimate the times
    - Add 25% on the estimated time (Allows a bit of wiggel)
    - Try to estimate more than you actually need. Everything that's over budget costs more!
    - Avoid ScopeGrip (Most of the time this happens, cause of the client!)
. Budget
    - Templates, Fonts
    - Hosting, Support
    - Content Maintenance
    - Subscriptions
    - Libraries
    - Time
    - Marketing
    - A lot more (depending on the Project (Hardware, Software))
    - Consider rent and salaries

== Write an offer (Basics)
. Try to write down what the clients problems are (Goals) (Requirements)
    - Proposal with a solution
    - Everyone can see what you accried to
. Deliverables
    - Things we actually deliver
    - Create some sort of milestones (You can check them, the client too)
    - Training lessons (for Client)
    - Manual
    - This shows the real scatual
    - on each deliverables shows the price (like a reciet)

. Break down the Goals and create user Stories
. Esamble the team
